## Other
Similar to my previous project [unity-folder-notes](https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/unity-folder-notes), differences:
- No custom inspectors, which required multiple implementations for each asset type, and broke some inspectors.
- Notes live in external files, which can be gitignored to be kept private, or commited to be shared.
