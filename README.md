# Unity note editor
Attach notes to Unity assets &amp; edit them in editor

Similar to my previous project [unity-folder-notes](https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/unity-folder-notes), differences:
- no custom inspectors, requiring multiple implementations for each asset type
- notes live in external files, which can be gitignored to be kept private, or commited to be shared.
